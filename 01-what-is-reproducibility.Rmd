# Background: Reproducibility

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
filter <- dplyr::filter
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10.5, fig.height=4, 
  comment=NA, rows.print=16)

## Reproducibility 

In this workshop, we are specifically interested in discussing ways in which to encourage
students (and professionals, and faculty!) to develop skills and habits for strong
reproducible research *methods*, particularly with 
respect to their data gathering, manipulation, and analysis. 

---

## Reproducible Research Methods

The first published work we are aware of that discusses the specific framework we are
thinking of (computational reproducibility) is 1990-92, J. Claerbout 
at Stanford:

<br/>

**J. Claerbout, M. Karrenbach**, *Electronic documents give reproducible research a new meaning*, in Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics, New Orleans, USA, 25 to 29 October 1992.

## Reproducible Research Methods

Some quotes:

<br/>
- a revolution in education and technology transfer follows from the marriage of word processing and software command scripts

--

- researchers ... can reproduce their own research results a year or more later by "pressing a single button"

--

- Our basic goal is reproducible research. The electronic document is our means to this end

--

## Definition

<br/>
... the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.
**This is the essential part of open science.**

<br/>
*Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility*

## Some Necessary Components

To make any research project **computationally** reproducible

- all data and files should be clearly: separated; labelled; documented
    
--

- all operations should be automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention 

--

- workflow should be designed as a sequence of steps (**scripts!**), combined so intermediate outputs from one step directly feed in as inputs to the next

--

- version control should be used

---

## Workflow Includes

- data acquisition

--

- data processing
    - entry
    - manipulation
    - filtering

--

- data analysis
    - computation of statistics
    - figures
    - model-fitting (including interim steps!) - avoid The Garden of Forking Paths!
    - linear flow, resist urge to modify earlier steps (HARKing)

---

## Researcher Point of View

I  strongly endorse **Data Carpentry**, a program of workshops teaching scientists
basic skills in this sort of thinking.

<br/>
If you do this kind of process for your research (and if you do statistics
as a primary focus, or as a tool in your research,  you *should*!), to do that
research properly, you have to know how to do this kind of thing!
